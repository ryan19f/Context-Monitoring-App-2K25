# Context-Monitoring-App-2K25
CSE 535 Project 1
## 1) Specifications for Health-Dev  

To generate the app code ideally with the Health-Dev framework, I would need to provide a full set of specifications.  

First, I’d describe **the problem and the intended users**. For example, the app could be aimed at young adults managing stress or patients recovering from illness. This includes what context I want the app to detect (like stress, rest, activity) and what outcomes I care about (symptom monitoring, early warnings).  

Next, I’d define **the signals to be collected**. This could include heart rate (via camera or wearable), respiration rate (from accelerometer or microphone), step counts, GPS for mobility patterns, and user-reported symptoms. I’d also specify how often to collect data — continuous, periodic bursts, or triggered by certain events.  

Then, I’d state the **privacy, permissions, and storage rules**. The app would need camera, sensor, and location permissions. Data should be encrypted, anonymized if possible, and stored either locally or securely on a server, with a clear retention policy.  

I’d provide a **data schema** describing exactly what fields to record — timestamps, sensor values, symptom severity levels, and any contextual labels. This ensures the framework understands the structure.  

For the **context model**, I’d define which states the app should recognize: resting, walking, commuting, sleeping, or stressed. I’d also specify thresholds or ML targets that mark transitions between states.  

Next is the **inference and personalization strategy**. I would clarify if I want models to run on the device for speed and privacy or on the cloud for heavier computation. I’d also indicate how the app should learn personal baselines, like adjusting for each user’s normal heart rate.  

The **feedback logic** is equally important: when the system detects a state such as “stressed,” it should send an appropriate intervention like a breathing exercise notification. Quiet hours or safe-timing rules should be included.  

Finally, I’d outline the **UX flow** (screens for consent, data logging, weekly reports, settings) and a **validation plan** with performance metrics like accuracy, energy usage, user engagement, and overall effectiveness.

## 2) Using bHealthy with Symptom Data  

In Project 1, the user’s symptoms were stored locally. By combining this with the **bHealthy application suite**, I can give feedback and build a model of the user.  

The first step is **integration**: take the symptom data (such as fatigue, stress, pain levels) and align it with physiological signals like heart rate and respiration. These data streams can be combined into a timeline for each user.  

Next is **user modeling**. I can create daily or hourly “state vectors” that summarize the person’s condition: average resting heart rate, activity level, symptom severity, and predicted stress or recovery score. With bHealthy’s tools, this model can be used to predict when symptoms might worsen or when interventions could help.  

For **feedback**, I’d use two strategies inspired by bHealthy:  
- **Just-in-time interventions**: send prompts when the system predicts stress or symptom flare-ups, like a reminder to drink water, take a walk, or do breathing exercises.  
- **Reports and trends**: generate weekly summaries that show patterns — for example, “Your stress scores were highest on days with less sleep, and your symptoms decreased after more activity.”  

To make the application **novel**, I’d add adaptivity. This means the app doesn’t just send generic notifications — it learns from how the user responds. If the person ignores morning reminders but responds to evening ones, the system adjusts its timing. If certain interventions consistently help, those get prioritized.  

This creates a **closed feedback loop**, where sensing leads to predictions, predictions lead to interventions, and interventions feed back into the model to improve personalization over time.

## 3) Views on Mobile Computing  

At first, I thought mobile computing was mostly about developing apps — writing code, designing user interfaces, and publishing them on app stores. But after doing Project 1 and reading the Health-Dev and bHealthy papers, I see that mobile computing goes much deeper.  

It’s really about **context-aware systems**. These systems don’t just display information — they sense the environment, collect and interpret data, and adapt to the user’s state. For example, Project 1 wasn’t just about making screens. It required defining which sensors to use, how to process heart rate and respiration, how to store and secure the data, and how to connect it all in real time.  

Mobile computing is also about **balancing trade-offs**: on-device versus cloud processing, accuracy versus battery life, privacy versus connectivity. It’s about ensuring the app works in daily life, where users may move, switch networks, or put the phone to sleep.  

Finally, it’s about **human-centered design and feedback**. The bHealthy suite shows that mobile computing involves creating interventions that actually help people change behavior or improve wellness, not just recording data.  

So my view has changed: mobile computing is about designing full **end-to-end systems** that combine sensing, modeling, privacy, usability, and feedback. It’s much bigger than just app development — it’s about creating intelligent, adaptive , and context-aware experiences.
